**Project Title:** Knapsack Optimization with Linear Programming

**Description:**
This project aims to solve the classic knapsack problem using linear programming (LP) techniques. The knapsack problem involves selecting a combination of items from a set with varying values, weights, and volumes to maximize the total value while staying within capacity constraints.

**Key Components:**
- Formulation of the knapsack problem as an LP model.
- Generation of LP input file using Python, including objective and constraint functions.
- Utilization of LP solver (e.g., LP Solve) to find the optimal solution.
- Exploration of how the solution changes with different lower bounds on the number of items to be placed in the knapsack.

**Results:**
- The LP solver is used to maximize the total value of items within given weight and volume constraints.
- The project provides insights into which items should be included in the knapsack to maximize the total value.
- It explores how different lower bounds on the number of items affect the solution.
- A graphical analysis shows how varying the weight and volume constraints impacts the total value.

**Note:**
The project includes LaTeX documentation, Python code for generating LP input files, and visualizations. Feel free to explore the LaTeX document for detailed explanations and analysis of the knapsack problem's solution.
